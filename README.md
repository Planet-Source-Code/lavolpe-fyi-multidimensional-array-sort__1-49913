## FYI: Multidimensional Array Sort


</div>

### Description

Another contribution to existing code. Very quickly sort a two-dimensional array containing any amount of members (ex: vArray(5,1000) by simply identifying the member of the array to sort on. This routine has links to the original authors' posts in the source. My only contribution was to tweak for use in more than a 1-dimensional & 2-dimensional/2-member arrays. Please no voting on this one; 99% of it is the work of other coders. PS. Revised by switching the array elements around properly,i.e, from vArray(1000,5) to vArray(5,1000). Revised once again (21 Nov) to offer fast search on sorted array & to properly handle non-zero based arrays.
